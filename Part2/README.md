# ParticleMotion
The **ParticleVisualize.cpp** and **ParticleMotion.h** are lightweight components for simulating and visualizing particle systems. They provide tools for rendering particle motion and defining particle behaviors.

## Key Features
- Simulate particle motion with customizable dynamics.
- Visualize particle systems in 2D/3D space.
- Support for integration with external rendering frameworks.
- Utility functions via the `ParticleMotion.h` header.

## Components Overview
### ParticleVisualize
- Rendering and visualization of particle systems.
- Integration with simulation data pipelines.

### ParticleMotion
- Definition of particle dynamics and behaviors.
- Utility functions for motion calculations.

## Requirements
- C++17 or newer.
- Compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- OpenGL, GLFW, and CMake.

## Example Usage
```bash
./ParticleVisualize
```
